#summary Some questions

[OpenDirector << home]

===1. Why?===
 * What's wrong with existing tools?
 * Why open source? 
 * Why not using an existing (open source) tool?

===2. What?===
 * Requirements:
  * 100% free and open source
  * 100% patent free technologies (for core app, plugins can deal with patented file/compression formats etc.)
  * easily expandable, SDK for plugins
  * support both code-based and visual development
  * nice to have: support multiple authoring concepts (e.g. both score and screen/form based)
  * support procedural and object-oriented programming
  * nice to have: support visual/dataflow programming
  * maybe: support some aspect-oriented programming?
  * pack VM/runtime engine into a self-contained executable ("projector") (unlike AIR or .NET)
  * nice to have: allow permanent installation of VM/runtime engine and thereby distribution/execution of smaller files (like shockwave projectors, JAR files, .NET, ...)
  * allow both usage of high-level cross-platform (e.g. wxWidget or GTK+ toolkit) and lower-level platform-specific (e.g. shell access, !DirectShow vs. Quartz, ...) technologies/frameworks

 * Supported patforms: 
  * Windows
  * OS X
  * Linux desirable

 * Components:
  * IDE
   * with timeline/score?
   * with screen/form management? flowchart? 
   * with asset managment?
   * with GUI builder/stage?
  * Script-Language
  * VM / Runtime Engine
  * Interpreter? Byte code compiler? JIT?
  * Plugin API
  
===3. How? (Architecture, Components, Technologies, Libraries/Frameworks)===
 * use existing VM / bytecode compiler (e.g. Lua VM, Python VM, Neko VM, Flash)?
  * build (score based) IDE for/on top of !HaXe/Neko?
  * build (score based) IDE for/on top of Python?
  * ceate flash wrapper for desktop apps (like zinc, but open source)?
 * IDE as extension of existing IDE (e.g. Eclipse)?
 * debatable: minimal core engine, ALL media support by plugins, *or* engine that already supports most important (patent-free) image/audio/video formats (e.g. PNG, JNG, WAV, OGG, SVG, Matroska)?
 
===4. Who?===
 * target group?
 * partners/sponsors?
 * how to convince developers to join?
